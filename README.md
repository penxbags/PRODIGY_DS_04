# PRODIGY_DS_04
Analyze and visualise sentiment in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
This project involves a sentiment analysis of tweets using a sample from a Twitter dataset. The analysis pipeline includes loading the data, preprocessing it to ensure valid tweet entries, and sampling a subset for efficiency. Sentiment scores are computed using TextBlob's polarity metric, which classifies tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. The results are visualized using Seaborn to provide insights into the distribution of tweet sentiments. This repository contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization
