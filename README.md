Analyze and visualise sentiment in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
The given code performs sentiment analysis on a subset of tweets from a dataset. It starts by loading the dataset and renaming columns for clarity. To ensure all entries are strings, it filters the 'Tweet' column. A sample of 1000 tweets is then selected for analysis. Using the TextBlob library, the code calculates the polarity of each tweet, which measures the sentiment from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). Based on this polarity score, tweets are categorized as 'Positive', 'Neutral', or 'Negative'. Finally, the code visualizes the sentiment distribution of the sampled tweets using a count plot, providing a clear overview of public opinion as expressed in the tweets.
